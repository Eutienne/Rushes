# Rushes

Rushes are small projects, you have to solve in 48 hours. For every rush there is something new to learn, like a language you haven't worked with yet.
It are projects you do togheter.

The Rushes I did are :

 - Numpy
 - Mexican Standoff
 - Cluedo (Prolog)
 - YASL
 
If you want to know more about these projects, you can check out the README in the specific sub-repository
