# Numpy

Numpy is a rush to introduce Numerical Python (NumPy). First you start with small exercises to learn to work with numpy.<br>
And in the end you create your own filters. I did this togheter with [@evitao](https://github.com/evitao)

## Project

This project will be done using an IPython Jupyter Notebook. A Dockerfile is provided to save you installation time.

Start by creating some matrices and arrays by following the requirements.

And after that create 4 commonly used image filters (non-grayscale).

We created the following filters:
 - Nashville
 - Hudson
 - Rise
 - Valencia
