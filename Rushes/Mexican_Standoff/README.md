# Mexican Standoff

In this Project, there is a battle between Vim and Emacs. And you will learn new features of both of those text editors.
I did this project togheter [@evitao](https://github.com/evitao)

## Goal

First you need to intialize some keyboard shortcuts in the .vimrc and .emacs file.
<br>Then you get a file and you need to make it norm proof in by only using your keyboard.
<br>Finally you have to create your own 42 header.

Those steps you need to do for both text editors.

## Bonus

Create more features, again for both text editors.
