# Cluedo (Prolog)

This is a project, that solves riddles. You need to write your code in Prolog. I did it togheter with [@evitao](https://github.com/evitao).

## Step 1

You have to make a family-tree program, that works kind of like a database.

## Step 2

Here you have to solve Einsteins riddle:

The situation<br>
There are 5 houses in five different colors.<br>
In each house lives a person with a different nationality.<br>
These five owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar and keep a certain pet.<br>
No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar or drink the same beverage.<br>
The question is: Who owns the fish?

Hints<br>
the Brit lives in the red house<br>
the Swede keeps dogs as pets<br>
the Dane drinks tea<br>
the green house is on the left of the white house<br>
the green house's owner drinks coffee<br>
the person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds<br>
the owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill<br>
the man living in the center house drinks milk<br>
the Norwegian lives in the first house<br>
the man who smokes blends lives next to the one who keeps cats<br>
the man who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill<br>
the owner who smokes BlueMaster drinks beer<br>
the German smokes Prince<br>
the Norwegian lives next to the blue house<br>
the man who smokes blend has a neighbor who drinks water<br>

## Step 3

Here you need to solve the wolf, goat, cabbage riddle:<br>
Once upon a time a farmer went to a market and purchased a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. On his way home, the farmer came to the bank of a river and rented a boat. But crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage.<br>
If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.<br>
The farmer's challenge was to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank of the river, leaving each purchase intact. How did he do it?
